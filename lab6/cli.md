# âš™ Command 
Here are the common commands I learned in the previous labs: 
- ls: List  information  about  the  FILEs  (the  current  directory  by default).
- cd: change the working directory.
- cat: concatenate files and print on the standard output.
- file: determine file type.
- du: estimate file space usage.
- find: estimate file space usage.
